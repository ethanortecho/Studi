# Premium Access - Testing Phase Configuration

## Current Status: ALL USERS HAVE PREMIUM (Testing Mode)

During the testing phase, all users automatically get premium access. This includes:
- All existing users (5 users updated)
- All new users who register

## What Was Changed

### 1. Model Default (`analytics/models.py`)
```python
# Changed from:
is_premium = models.BooleanField(default=False, ...)

# To:
is_premium = models.BooleanField(default=True, ...)  # For testing
```

### 2. Database Migration
- Migration: `0025_default_premium_true.py`
- Applied on: August 27, 2025

### 3. Existing Users
- All 5 existing users were updated to premium via management command

## How to Revert for Production

When you're ready to launch and implement real premium features:

### Step 1: Update the Model
```bash
# Edit analytics/models.py
# Change is_premium default back to False
```

### Step 2: Create New Migration
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations -n revert_default_premium
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 3: Remove Premium from Non-Paying Users
```bash
# Option A: Remove from all users
python manage.py set_all_premium --undo

# Option B: Selectively keep some users premium
python manage.py shell
>>> from analytics.models import CustomUser
>>> # Keep specific users premium
>>> CustomUser.objects.exclude(username__in=['paying_user1', 'paying_user2']).update(is_premium=False)
```

## Management Commands Available

### Grant Premium to All Users
```bash
python manage.py set_all_premium
```

### Remove Premium from All Users
```bash
python manage.py set_all_premium --undo
```

### Check Current Status
```bash
python manage.py shell -c "from analytics.models import CustomUser; print(f'Premium users: {CustomUser.objects.filter(is_premium=True).count()}/{CustomUser.objects.count()}')"
```

## Testing Notes

- Premium gates still exist in code but allow everyone through
- Easy to toggle back for production launch
